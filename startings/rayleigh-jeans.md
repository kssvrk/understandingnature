## Rayleigh jeans law

A black body is an idealized opaque, non-reflective body. It absorbs all different wavelengths and emits energy in a wide spectrum of wavelengths. The energies absorbed do not have any relation to the emitted energies, except that the absorbed energies change the temperature of black body. This happens due to the nature that the black body is built. When the body absorbs energy, the particles ( atoms / electrons / what ever ) , are sent into an higher energy state and there by the temperature increases.

The emitted energies of black body essentially depend on the internal temperature of the black body. Temperature can be a yard stick to measure which emissions will be most prominent or the energy distribution. But what is the mechanism through which this distribution of energy occurs across frequencies for any given temperature T.

Experimentally it was known that as the temperature increases , the wavlengths that have the maximum energy in the emission decrease. So on either ends of the wavelengths the intensities keep rising till they reach a peak at somewhere in the middle.

To understand this , we have to come to terms with a theory which could explain why this is happening. This was a very active problem and lies at the juncture of dividing classical and quantum physics. This was attempted by Rayleigh and Jeans through classical physics and Max planck solving the problem using the ideas from Quantum physics.

But before all this some of the main fundamental ideas behind the assumption that a black body radiates energy lies inside kinetic theory of gasses and then assuming Light as photon gas exerting some pressue.

## Black Body description and Initial efforts


### Kirchoff 

There is a reason why we call black bodys as kirchoff's black bodies, it's because it was Gustav Kirchhoff  who derived the relation that the ratio of emissivity to absorptivity for any body for a specific wavelength remains same when talking in terms of black body radiations. [Ref-1 : Kirchoff](#reference)

### Josef Stefan

In 1864, Irish physicist John Tyndall did measurements of the infrared emission by the platinum filament, and the corresponding
colour of filament.In Tyndallâ€™s measurements, Stefan noticed that by increasing the temperature of platinum filament from 798K to 1473K
(1.845 times), radiation was increased by 11.7 times (approximate to ($1.845^{4}$). So he empirically stated that the energy emitted by a black-body per unit area per second is proportional to the
fourth power of the absolute temperature. [Ref-1 : Stefan](#reference)

$$ E \propto T^{4} $$

### Kinetic theory of gasses

[Ref-2 : Kinetic theory derivations](#reference)

Assume that we have a cube filled with gas particles. The gas particles  are uniformly moving in all directions. If we need to calculate the pressure exerted by these gas particles let say on the wall on the +X side ( assuming cube is centered around 3 - axes) , we need to know the force exerted by these particles. Assuming that all the collisions in the gas are elastic at any particular interval we need to count the number of particles hitting one end of this cube. Let us assume that the mass of the gass particles is $m$ grams each. 

The way that we calculate the force will be to calculate the change of momentum of particles for a change in time. Now the particles that will reach the right wall in this time interval are the particles whose velocity will allow them to do so. So if we take a time interval $\triangle t$ , 

###  Ludwig Boltzmann

The underdog and the most important in connecting energy of a gas to the black body radition is Ludwig boltzman. He was a student of Josef stefan. He used the idea of radiation pressure to calculate thermodynamic energy of light system. To understand this in detail let us first understand a little bit about the kinetic theory of gasses.
