## Rayleigh jeans law

A black body is an idealized opaque, non-reflective body. It absorbs all different wavelengths and emits energy in a wide spectrum of wavelengths. The energies absorbed do not have any relation to the emitted energies, except that the absorbed energies change the temperature of black body. This happens due to the nature that the black body is built. When the body absorbs energy, the particles ( atoms / electrons / what ever ) , are sent into an higher energy state and there by the temperature increases.

The emitted energies of black body essentially depend on the internal temperature of the black body. Temperature can be a yard stick to measure which emissions will be most prominent or the energy distribution. But what is the mechanism through which this distribution of energy occurs across frequencies for any given temperature T.

Experimentally it was known that as the temperature increases , the wavlengths that have the maximum energy in the emission decrease. So on either ends of the wavelengths the intensities keep rising till they reach a peak at somewhere in the middle.

To understand this , we have to come to terms with a theory which could explain why this is happening. This was a very active problem and lies at the juncture of dividing classical and quantum physics. This was attempted by Rayleigh and Jeans.
